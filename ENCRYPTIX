Task 2: Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow the user
to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std ;
int main() {
     long  double number1, number2 ;
     char operation ;
   cout<<"Enter the number 1"<<endl;
    cin>>number1;
   cout<<"Enter the number 2"<<endl;
    cin>>number2;
  cout<<"Enter your arithmetic operation"<<endl;
    cin>>operation;
  if(operation == '+'){
      cout<<"number1+number2 = "<<number1 + number2<<endl;
  }
  else if(operation == '-'){
      cout<<"number1-number2 = "<<number1 - number2<<endl;
  }
  else if(operation == '*'){
      cout<<"number1*number2 = "<<number1 * number2<<endl;
  }
  else if(operation == '/'){
      cout<<"number1/number2 = "<<number1 / number2<<endl;
      
  }
   return 0;
}
